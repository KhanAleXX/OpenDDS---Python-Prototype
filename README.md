The WHISPER application is a prototype based on classified AEGIS Weapon System (AWS) programs that use DDS. The Data Distribution Service (DDS) is a networking middleware which, using the publisher-subscriber pattern, sends and receives data among nodes. Data produced by publishers is delivered by DDS to the subscribers interested in that particular topic. In our project, we developed a server application that feeds data to multiple clients by using the open-source OpenDDS service and Yelpâ€™s Fusion Application Programming Interface (API). Based on the DDS requests from the clients, the server retrieves data from the Fusion API about the requested businesses, processes that data (initially returned in the form of a JSON object), and displays the useful information to the correct clients via DDS.
